**SEE DEV BRANCH FOR SQL TXT FILE INSTRUCTIONS**


This is the main branch of the PMS. Included in these files are class files that are beginning with DB representing database files and PMS representing the main logic and GUI of the PMS

Currently, we are using the JDBC to connect to a MySQL database. The database is hosted on your local machine currently. Go to http://www.mysql.com to get a download of the latest version of Community Server and MySQL Workbench. The first is necessary to utilize MySQL, the latter is for ease-of-use to implement tables and schemas without having much knowledge.

Please check the issues listed. These are issues currently being worked on. If you feel you want to work on them, assign yourself the issue. Please clone from the DEV branch of the repo and only input pull requests until an additional member of the team can review the changes. COMMENT YOUR CODE.
