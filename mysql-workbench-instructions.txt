When opening MySQL workbench, create a new connection:
	
		Hostname: localhose
		Port: 3306
		Username: root
		Password: root

These need to match for the program to run. 

Once in, go ahead and create a new schema, name this schema "doggo"

Click on the schema on the bottom left, and then click at the top "create table"

Name the table "login", and create a column, and then create a second column named "username". DELETE THE FIRST COLUMN for now
"username" should be your first column now, create a second column named "password" and then create a third column named "admin". All of these should be of the type VARCHAR

click create and ok. 

Open up a new Query and type the following script
	
		> INSERT INTO LOGIN (username, password, admin) VALUES ("user", "test", "1"); 
		> INSERT INTO LOGIN (username, password, admin) VALUES ("user2", "user1", "0");
		> SELECT * FROM LOGIN
		
You should see the two employees you entered into the table from the query line. Great.

Repeat the steps listed before the query but this time you need to create columns in order:
	id_num, last_name, first_name, room_num, room_type, check_in, check_out  >> table name: arriving
	id_num, last_name, first_name, room_num, room_type, check_in, check_out  >> table name: in_house
	id_num, last_name, first_name, room_type, cancelled_on  				 >> table name: cancellations
	
	
You can insert anything into your program, as long as the tables are the same you shouldn't have to adjust any of
the code in the program to connect to the database. They are listed as constants in the program but are editable should
you run into issues.
